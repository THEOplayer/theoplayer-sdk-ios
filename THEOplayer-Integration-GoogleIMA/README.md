# THEOplayerSDK GoogleIMA Integration

THEOplayerSDK brings the universal video player solution created by [THEO Technologies](https://www.theoplayer.com/) to iOS and tvOS, enabling you to quickly deliver cross-platform content playback.

This is the GoogleIMA integration framework which comes as a standalone module to extend the THEOplayer core SDK and enable playing Google Interactive Media Advertisements. The module supports both client side ads with IMA and server side ads with DAI (Dynamic Ad Insertion).
